"""
This package provides classes to allow a multi-threaded
importing of data. It defines a base class `Worker` from
which other multi-threaded workers derive to define their
specific importing logic.

Some workers such as `ZipWorker` and `SqlWorker` don't
have an importing functionality on their own, but are
used as a mixin in more specialized classes such as
`FcaWorker` and `DfpItrWorker`.
